# Trivia

Welcome to UselessGames company. The codebase in front of you represents the **trivia game** which has been very successful and the sales team forecast an opportunity to expand its reach even more if we could add the "history" category. Unfortunately the only developer in charge of this codebase left 2 days ago, and you are tasked with expanding it.

Can you do it?

### Notes
There's one useful tsconfig setting which has been disabled to avoid tsc yelling at us that something could be wrong:
`"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true`
